  "Don’t you know the poems of Han-shan?
They’re better for you than scripture-reading.
Cut them out and paste them on a screen,
Then you can gaze at them from time to time.

A thousand clouds, ten thousand streams,
Here I live, an idle man,
Roaming green peaks by day,
Back to sleep by cliffs at night.
One by one, springs and autumns go,
Free of heat and dust, my mind.
Sweet to know there’s nothing I need,
Silent as the autumn river’s flood.

Han-shan has his critics too:
‘Your poems, there’s nothing in them!’
I think of men of ancient times,
Poor, humble, but not ashamed.
Let him laugh at me and say:
‘It’s all foolishness, your work!’
Let him go on as he is,
All his life lost making money.

Where’s the trail to Cold Mountain?
Cold Mountain? There’s no clear way.
Ice, in summer, is still frozen.
Bright sun shines through thick fog.
You won’t get there following me.
Your heart and mine are not the same.
If your heart was like mine,
You’d have made it, and be there!

Cold Mountain’s full of strange sights
Men who go there end by being scared.
Water glints and gleams in the moon,
Grasses sigh and sing in the wind.
The bare plum blooms again with snow,
Naked branches have clouds for leaves.
When it rains, the mountain shines –
In bad weather you’ll not make this climb.

A thousand clouds, ten thousand streams,
Here I live, an idle man,
Roaming green peaks by day,
Back to sleep by cliffs at night.
One by one, springs and autumns go,
Free of heat and dust, my mind.
Sweet to know there’s nothing I need,
Silent as the autumn river’s flood.

High, high, the summit peak,
Boundless the world to sight!
No one knows I am here,
Lone moon in the freezing stream.
In the stream, where’s the moon?
The moon’s always in the sky.
I write this poem: and yet,
In this poem there is no Zen.

Thirty years in this world
I wandered ten thousand miles,
By rivers, buried deep in grass,
In borderlands, where red dust flies.
Tasted drugs, still not Immortal,
Read books, wrote histories.
Now I’m back at Cold Mountain,
Head in the stream, cleanse my ears.

Bird-song drowns me in feeling.
Back to my shack of straw to sleep.
Cherry-branches burn with crimson flower,
Willow-boughs delicately trail.
Morning sun flares between blue peaks,
Bright clouds soak in green ponds.
Who guessed I’d leave that dusty world,
Climbing the south slope of Cold Mountain?

I travelled to Cold Mountain:
Stayed here for thirty years.
Yesterday looked for family and friends.
More than half had gone to Yellow Springs.
Slow-burning, life dies like a flame,
Never resting, passes like a river.
Today I face my lone shadow.
Suddenly, the tears flow down.

Alive in the mountains, not at rest,
My mind cries for passing years.
Gathering herbs to find long life,
Still I’ve not achieved Immortal.
My field’s deep, and veiled in cloud,
But the wood’s bright, the moon’s full.
Why am I here? Can’t I go?
Heart still tied to enchanted pines!

If there’s something good, delight!
Seize the moment while it flies!
Though life can last a hundred years,
Who’s seen their thirty thousand days?
Just an instant then you’re gone.
Why sit whining over things?
When you’ve read the Classics through,
You’ll know quite enough of death.

The peach petals would like to stay,
But moon and wind blow them on.
You won’t find those ancient men,
Those dynasties are dead and gone.
Day by day the blossoms fall,
Year by year the people go.
Where the dust blows through these heights,
There once shone a silent sea.

Men who see the Master
Of Cold Mountain, say he’s mad.
A nothing face,
Body clothed in rags.
Who dare say what he says?
When he speaks we can’t understand.
Just one word to you who pass –
Take the trail to Cold Mountain!

Han-shan has his critics too:
‘Your poems, there’s nothing in them!’
I think of men of ancient times,
Poor, humble, but not ashamed.
Let him laugh at me and say:
‘It’s all foolishness, your work!’
Let him go on as he is,
All his life lost making money.

Cold Mountain holds a naked bug,
Its body’s white, its head is black.
In its hands a pair of scrolls,
One the Way and one its Power.
It needs no pots or stove.
Without clothes it wanders on,
But it carries Wisdom’s blade,
To cut down mindless craving.

I’m on the trail to Cold Mountain.
Cold Mountain trail never ends.
Long clefts thick with rock and stones,
Wide streams buried in dense grass.
Slippery moss, but there’s been no rain,
Pine trees sigh, but there’s no wind.
Who can leap the world’s net,
Sit here in the white clouds with me?

Men ask the way through the clouds,
The cloud way’s dark, without a sign.
High summits are of naked rock.
In deep valleys sun never shines.
Behind you green peaks, and in front,
To east the white clouds, and to west –
Want to know where the cloud way lies?
It’s there, in the centre of the Void!

Sitting alone by folded rocks,
Mist swirling even at noon,
Here, inside my room, it’s dark.
Mind is bright, clear of sound.
Through the shining gate in dream.
Back by the stone bridge, mind returns.
Where now the things that troubled me?
Wind-blown gourd rattling in the tree.

Far-off is the place I chose to live.
High hills make for silent tongues.
Gibbons screech in valley cold
My gate of grass blends with the cliff.
A roof of thatch among the pines,
I dig a pool, feed it from the stream.
No time now to think about the world,
The years go by, shredding ferns.

Level after level, falls and hills,
Blue-green mist clasped by clouds.
Fog wets my flimsy cap,
Dew soaks my coat of straw.
A pilgrim’s sandals on my feet,
An old stick grasped in my hand.
Gazing down towards the land of dust,
What is that world of dreams to me?

What a road the Cold Mountain road!
Not a sign of horse or cart.
Winding gorges, tricky to trace.
Massive cliffs, who knows how high?
Where the thousand grasses drip with dew,
Where the pine trees hum in the wind.
Now the path’s lost, now it’s time
For body to ask shadow: ‘Which way home?’

Always it’s cold on this mountain!
Every year, and not just this.
Dense peaks, thick with snow.
Black pine-trees breathing mist.
It’s summer before the grass grows,
Not yet autumn when the leaves fall.
Full of illusions, I roam here,
Gaze and gaze, but can’t see the sky.

No knowing how far it is,
This place where I spend my days.
Tangled vines move without a breeze,
Bamboo in the light shows dark.
Streams down-valley sob for whom?
Mists cling together, who knows why?
Sitting in my hut at noon,
Suddenly, I see the sun has risen.

The everyday mind: that is the way.
Buried in vines and rock-bound caves,
Here it’s wild, here I am free,
Idling with the white clouds, my friends.
Tracks here never reach the world;
No-mind, so what can shift my thought?
I sit the night through on a bed of stone,
While the moon climbs Cold Mountain.

I was off to the Eastern Cliff.
Planned that trip for how long?
Dragged myself up by hanging vines,
Stopped halfway, by wind and fog.
Thorn snatched my arm on narrow tracks,
Moss so deep it drowned my feet,
So I stopped, under this red pine.
Head among the clouds, I’ll sleep.

Bright water shimmers like crystal,
Translucent to the furthest depth.
Mind is free of every thought
Unmoved by the myriad things.
Since it can never be stirred
It will always stay like this.
Knowing, this way, you can see,
There is no within, no without.

Are you looking for a place to rest?
Cold Mountain’s good for many a day.
Wind sings here in the black pines,
Closer you are, the better it sounds.
There’s an old man sitting by a tree,
Muttering about the things of Tao.
Ten years now, it’s been so long
This one’s forgotten his way home.

Cold rock, no one takes this road.
The deeper you go, the finer it is.
White clouds hang on high crags.
On Green Peak a lone gibbon’s cry.
What friends do I need?
I do what pleases me, and grow old.
Let face and body alter with the years,
I’ll hold to the bright path of mind.")

  '("I would like to write something about how I’ve found God to be a very interesting and useful entity to relate to but it’s kind of weird. It started with a book recommended to me about a new metaphor for understanding Aquinas’s modification of Aristotelian virtue ethics."

"The metaphor is based on the concept “joint attention” from social cognition research which is like the main thing that autistic children won’t do with their parents, the meeting of minds that comes from playing together, looking together at something."

"As a parent I had never thought much about this phenomenon but immediately when I read about it, I realized how important it is, and I started paying attention to this daily thing of “seeing together” with my toddler son."

"It’s also present in friend relationships and when working together, but with two adults it’s sometimes a bit less clear, because you’re both so individuated, it can be kind of rare to really “meet” in this attuned way."

"But there’s such a fascinating type of transmission that happens in the parent–child relationship when this joint attention is active; it’s like I’m lending my mind, my gaze, my perspective to the child."

"So I don’t just teach the child by instruction and imitation but also we meet up in this joint space where our own individual minds merge within a common realm, we’re not necessarily talking, we’re fusing our phenomenologies to some extent."

"And as the parent I am responsible for bringing something to this joint attention space, which the child isn’t yet capable of. I feel like I must enact qualities like stability of attention, and I help guide our mutual gaze, steadying it, somehow correcting it when necessary."

"Like I can physically hold the child in my arms, or hold his hand as he walks on an icy road, but there’s also this kind of gentle holding in the joint attention, which happens through subtler attunements."

"And so I can also imagine what it’s like for a child to have the presence of a safe caretaker not only in terms of handholding but also as this subtler guiding presence in the whole arena of attention and perception."

"Of course the point with Aquinas is that adult humans can have an analogous relation with the guiding parental presence they call God or Christ."

"I’m especially interested in this because I was basically researching the phenomenology of ADHD and how such attentional disorders could be thought of from a virtue ethical perspective given that they seem to disrupt basic virtuous capacities."

"First I looked into the general literature about virtue ethics and disability and I shouldn’t have been surprised to find that the dominant strand in that weave is exactly the Christian inversion of the surrounding Greco-Roman ethics of strength and excellence."

"That was fascinating in itself because I thought virtue ethics and disability was a rather obscure intersection of interests but then I realize it’s actually at the center of the whole story of Christianity."

"Aristotelian virtue ethical teaching starts with the assumption of a healthy \\& well-raised property-owning male free citizen of the Athenian polis, and provides him with a framework for understanding and further developing his practical skills and virtuous friendships."

"Sick and disabled people, along with women and slaves, are more or less scoped out of relevance to this style of training in excellence. Jesus comes along and specifically preaches God’s love for the sick \\& disabled, for women \\& slaves."

"The Christians proclaim a gospel where the most important kind of happiness, and indeed salvation, doesn’t depend upon the virtues glorified by the Greco-Roman culture; it’s universal in the sense that its fruits aren’t contingent on bodily strength or virtuous excellence."

"Now Aquinas is the pinnacle of the synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Christian theology, so it’s really interesting to see how he brings these seemingly radically different perspectives together."

"But it seems that clear intuitive understanding of the Aquinas system is not easy to find. MacIntyre wrote “After Virtue” before he became a Thomist and that book doesn’t really explain Aquinas, rather it is vaguely skeptical towards him."

"Mostly the explanations seem rather dry and weird. He changes the definition of virtue a bit, and then adds a whole new set of different virtues, and it all just seems pretty confusing and epicyclical, a bunch of religious metaphysical nonsense strapped onto a pagan virtue ethics."

"So in 2012 Andrew Pinsent publishes this book called “The Second-Person Perspective in Aquinas’s Ethics: Virtues and Gifts” which laments this lack of intuitive explanation and proposes joint attention as a fundamental image to illuminate and make sense of the whole scheme."

"Pinsent tells a story at the end of the book of how his initial idea came after seeing a parent and a daughter playing, and having a sense that he could see almost in real time how the daughter was growing as a person through this “infusion” of attention provided by the parent."

"He then thought about how Aristotle didn’t have much concrete to say about a situation like this which is so different from the self-reliant habituation that grows the Aristotelian virtues like muscles grown in a gymnasium."

"Aquinas, having subsumed Aristotle under the Christian theology, is able to discuss the habitual trained virtues alongside other qualities which are transmitted in a different way, with an immediacy that seems mysterious from a “pagan” perspective."

"So there’s another kind of channel for acquiring good qualities, different from the worldly virtues of athletics or architecture, and this channel is open right away even for infants."

"So the “gifts” in Aquinas’s system are qualities that emerge from being in a state of joint attention with God, where I can address God in the second person as “you” because he is felt as a presence within my field of experience, not as an object but as a cooperative subject."

"For me this was all revelatory as to why Christians would insist God is a person with whom one can have a personal relationship, and why the previously strange-seeming practice of praying to a “father” or a “lord” who doesn’t appear in the world."

"It provided an exceedingly clear psychological explanation for the power of such a relationship, regardless of the ontological status of God himself and regardless of the historical status of Jesus performing miracles and being resurrected."

"So in my secular frame it quite suddenly made a lot of sober sense to just start trying to see what happens if I invite God into joint attention with my own perception."

"That didn’t mean I have to try to reach God to see him or hear his voice; I only had to kind of shift my mindset into one where I assume I might not be alone within my own gaze at the world."

"So I hypothesize that I am a child, my attention wavering and unwise, but that just outside my field of vision there is a “heavenly father” whose wisdom and stability I can only vaguely surmise—and I let this being see with me, I try to see together with him."

"Now is it possible for me to make any use of a heavenly wisdom that I don’t actually possess? Well, that almost seems like an experimental question. And my feeling is that God, taken as a hypothetical source of wise attunement, in fact is somehow present within me."

"I can feel this while making no supernatural claim, because it’s still compatible with an explanation like “this God is just a projected intuitive perfection of a wise inclination that my mind has just by virtue of innate evolved intelligence”."

"Even so, it feels like a discovery that such a projection can be efficacious and inspiring when I put it to work as a parental figure in joint attention with me, putting myself in the posture of a playing child guided by the wisdom of an innate parental conscience."

"Pinsent proposes that this Aquinian way of understanding faith can illuminate secular interactions, such as between parent and child. Of course I have no ambition to be like a God for my child—but I have to play the role of father in our joint attentional relationship."

"For some time now I have been praying on a regular basis, meaning I take some time to address God as “you” while attending to the circumstances of life, as a kind of meditation that charges the mental atmosphere with wisdom and glory."

"And it feels like a remarkably potent, fascinating, beautiful, and intuitive psychotechnology, entirely aside from what I might believe about the ancient hallucinations of the Israelite prophets and whatnot."))
