* Introduction

  This is a Common Lisp system for playing with e-paper screens.

  I'm using the [[https://www.waveshare.com/10.3inch-e-paper-hat.htm][Waveshare 10.3" display]] connected via GPIO/SPI to a
  [[https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/][Raspberry Pi 400]].

  The only way to run the system is to load it and play around with
  various Lisp functions; there's no coherent entry point yet.
