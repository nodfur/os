   Darling remember       from when you come to me
Em                 C           Asus2        Asus2/C
   That I’m the pretender, I’m not what I’m supposed to be
Am                C              G        D

Em                  C    Asus2              Asus2/C
   They caught the katy,      and left me a mule to ride
Em             C    Asus2          Asus2/C
   The fortune lady came along she walked beside
Am           C              G         D
   But every word seemed to date her
              Am         C                  D

  Up in the morning      up and on the ride
Em              C       Asus2            Asus2/C
  I drive in to Corning      and all the spindles whine
Am          C              G          D
   And ever day is getting straighter

   I’ll go back to Cali,     where I can sleep out every night
Am               C                  G      D
   and watch the waves and move the fader
              Am         C                  D

G                     Am
    I bet against the company again
G                     Am
    They tried to redefine

    Like a nail down through the heart
G                            Am
    That just don't beat the same anymore
G                         Am

   Far away my, there's a black sun risin' overhead
             G                         Am
   There's a moon through the midnight rain
G                       Am
   How can I surround myself in time and time again?
G                     Am
   How can I be free?
G                        Am
   Just wanna lay in the moonlight
           G                             Am
   See the light shining, see you in the outline
G                    Am
   It never gets too dark to find
G             Am
   Anybody at anytime

F                      Am
   I'm at the darkened hillside
                 G                            Am
   And there's a haze right between the trees
F                   Am
   And I can barely see you
                  G   F                Am
   You're like an ocean in between the waves

Verse:

 C                       D
Come on baby, hold me close
                        C
Let me do my best to both,
                      D
let me ride, let it roll
C                       D
I was there to catch a man
                            C
I thought I had him by the hand
                         D
I only had him by the glove

Verse:

C                    D
Come on baby, let me in
                          C
You can show yourself to him
                              D
You can show me through the doors
C                          D
And I was there, catching air
                         C
Thought I had him by the hand
                         D
I only had him by the glove
</pre>
<pre>
C                      D
We was there, in the road
                          C
Picking diamonds from a tree
                          D
Heard a wolf coming through
C                           D
Coming through and coming hard,
                             C
Tried to leave the heat and gone
                            D
Tried to lean against the wall

Bridge:  C   D   C   D (x2)

Verse:

C                      D
I'll be there, coming clean
                       C
Like a runner in the wind
                             D
Coming through the morning light
C                    D
Rising in, in the stone
                             C
Tried to leave the heat at home
                              D
Running through the morning dim
</pre>
<pre>
C                          D
And I was there, to catch a man
                         C
Thought I had him by the hand
                         D
I only had him by the glove
C                      D
Come on baby, let me close
                        C
Let me do my best to both
                       D
Run through but cut close

Verse:

C                    D
Come on baby, let me in
                         C
You can show yourself to him
                          D
Ride the road, ride it rough
C                       D
Yeah in the day I was gone,
                             C
Tried to leave the heat at home
                           D
Run through and run the road
</pre>
<pre>
C                      D
I was there, coming clean
                      C
Like a runner in the wind
                            D
Coming through the morning light
C                         D
You'll be there, on the floor
                           C
Picking diamonds from a stone
                           D
Looking through the totem pole
