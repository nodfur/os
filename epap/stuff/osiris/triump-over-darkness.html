<p>
  Here begin the praises and glorifying of coming out from and going
  into the glorious Neterkhert in the beautiful Amenta, of coming
  forth by day in all the transformations which please him, of playing
  at senet and of setting in the sekh hall, and coming forth as a
  living soul.
</p>

<p>
  Every season of the flood I saw god born from the buttocks of a
  cow. She was mighty in fullness as was the river and likewise, the
  two of them struggled up toward higher ground. There upon the stony
  earth, the cow strained against the pain, the sharp hooves of the
  animal kicking inside her, even as the calf strained against the
  dark belly of its mothers. They were warriors of a common purpose. I
  reached in, my hand slick and full of the primeval waters. Then,
  feeling bone beneath skin, I gently drew the two legs out. With a
  heave life was born into my hands. And the cow rested licking her
  calf's steaming head still wet and shining from its mother's body.
</p>

<p>
  The ways of making are indeed wondrous&mdash;the child born of its
  mother, the sun rolling into sky, the song rising from the lips, the
  world springing from the word of god. The essence of life is
  brilliant, dazzling. I can not exlain such miracles, yet I embody
  them daily. Though I can not remember my birth and shall forget my
  death, I live in the midst of wonder.
</p>

<p>
  I stand, therefore, before myself and god, before Ra and Ptah and
  Osiris. I am one of those lights I see, an ember of fire climbing
  the back of heaven and heaven takes me in. I am its child, loved
  by gods.
</p>

<p>
  I am a man walking the path, separating the nettles from the
  flowers. I am myself who perceives who I am. I am my heart's
  witness. I am an animal, the breath and blood of myself responding
  to tides, constant as sun, mutable as moon. I am baboon driven by
  instinct. I am a jackal devouring the meat of life, thirsty for the
  stream of being. I swallow the world, I digest it, I am nourished by
  it. No possibility is left untasted. I am a falcom, a form of earth
  that rises. I am one who soars to heaven and brings home a
  message. I leap up from matter to ride the current of spirit.
</p>

<p>
  I am a lover of truth. I cut away lies, these rags of mortality. I
  am incense on the altar, seven grain of moly smouldering in flame,
  seven sparks dancing in the air. Seven heron fly in the light of
  Osiris. Seven fish leap from the river into the birds' mouths. Seven
  stars dream in the northern sky nestled in the lap of a bear. There
  is a serpent writhing through heaven, unbound by the weight of
  earth. His tongue flicks flames. He licks the finger of gods, but
  the snake left to earth licks only dark and dust.
</p>

<p>
  &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the lord of life to the lord of death one day. &ldquo;Let us
  make a truce. I shall bring forth creatures and deliver then unto
  death, if you deliver the dead unto life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
  &ldquo;Why should I bequeath my powers to you?&rdquo; asked death.
</p>

<p>
  &ldquo;It is simple enough. If you do not, I shall make no creatures at
  all. Then what good will your strength do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
  &ldquo;I see your point. But what good is death in the face of life, or
  for that matter, what good is life in the face of death?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
  <i>In the Luxor Pyramid...</i>
</p>

<p>
  The two gods argued this way and that and the coversation fell upon
  the ears of truth, &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said truth, for he was the great
  uniter and wanted also to show his power. &ldquo;Surely there is a way to
  settle this matter. You, god of life, shall make two of all your
  creatures, one visible and the other invisible. Death may take them,
  but he must keep only one. The body shall be his to do with as he
  pleases. The spirit he shall return to life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
  And so it was done that the world would remain constant in
  balance. They embraced one another and became one body of god. These
  are life and death. These are two eyes of Ra, one offering light and
  one burning up flesh.
</p>

<p>
  On the day I saw Ra born from the buttocks of a cow I was overcome
  with weeping. How young was the calf, its life spread out before
  it. How close to death was the old cow, its mother. And I saw two
  worlds move closer together, the hand of one god passing a soul into
  the hand of the other. Was the mystery one of joy or sorrow?
</p>

<p>
  Many days passed since the day I fell from the womb. Already I am
  old and know more men dead now than alive. The calf born that day is
  many years gone. I gaze into the depths of the Nile. By what shall I
  gauge eternity? Does the river flow on with the same water? At night
  I dream the heavens are full of bodies, lights and shadows, the
  souls of men and women returning.
</p>

<p>
  These are the manifestations of Horus, a thousand thousand souls in
  his train, an army marching against darkness. These are souls
  returning to earth, men and women beatified. One spirit veiled in
  flesh may stand upright, white as tusks. One swirls in ether, total
  substance of gods. One sails through Egypt propelled by the breath
  of fire. One counts the wheat grains like the gods' endless
  hours. One weaves the cloth of dreams that clothe his brothers. One
  walks by day and watches by night. A thousand forms are the souls of
  Horus who set up lights in the darkness, who heal the sick, who
  write the books, who build the temples, who raise the children, who
  feed the people, who push the plow, who dance under stars, who dream
  of holy dreams. The words of power were conferred on them in Amentet
  that they might become the backbone of heaven.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, with regularity, the spirit returns to its source to bask
  in the wonders of god, to draw strength from the fire, then go into
  the world to rage against the serpent of darkness. Therefore, the
  gods together are one. Therefore, I am the double seal of gods. I am
  priest of my own becoming, of the holiness of change, of the ways of
  Osiris and of Ra&mdash;a spirit of glory as the hawk, a spirit of
  strength as the ram. I am a light, a fire, a purpose, a rager
  against oblivion.
</p>

<p>
  As the forms of light are numerous, so are the forms of
  darkness. The shapes of good and evil are hidden. I discern the
  fruit from the poison. In the house of death there waits a being of
  darkness whose eyebrows swim on his forehead like fishes. There is
  one of light whose two arms are the scales. One goddess recounts a
  man's history on the night of reckoning. The tongue of another burns
  rotten meat in its fire. There is the knife that would sunder what a
  man brings together. There is the knife that would cut away
  filth. There are clothes of light and skins of darkness. There are
  two snakes asleep in dark waters. One rises up with the head of man
  speaking. One rises up with two heads&mdash;one full of honor, the other
  full of deceit. The first snake is evil, easy enough to
  recognize. The second snake is the good son Horus, avenger of his
  father, soldier of truth. To those who tell lies, he confronts them
  with lies. To those who speak truths, Horus speaks truth. He is the
  passageway into the forms both golden and terrible.
</p>

<p>
  May I know the truth when I see it. May I stand on the lotus, a son
  of god, and rise like perfume unto the god's nostrils. May my
  fingernails turn into thorns to drive back the snake. May my arms
  become spears to thwart crocodiles. May the light of my soul detect
  shadows of evil. May I listen to the voice of the messenger. May I
  walk the road envisioned by Ra's eyes. May my spirit gather my
  selves and fly back to its source. May I join the great march of
  beings who live and die in the circle of light.
</p>

<p>
  I shall not fall under flashing knives. I shall not burn up in the
  cauldron. I know the names of the scorpions and they are these:
  anger, bitterness and doubt. And I know the names of the serpents:
  ego, concern for the self of the body; relinquishment of destiny,
  the attribution of suffering to god; false pity that stifles another
  man's becoming; mediocre virtues and the denial of passion;
  sentimentality wherein passion is artifice; satisfaction wherein he
  fails to attain the great; common thought wherein a man seeks not to
  push himself beyond the limits of his own imagination.
</p>

<p>
  I am he who walks around heaven breathing the hot flame of the mouth
  of he who circles the edges of heaven making himself invisible,
  commanding the spirits of his peopel. I am radiant earth. I am a
  warrior of light. I burn musk and moly on the altar. I come forth
  from green fields. I roll gold into life like a beetle. I soar like
  a hawk. I squawk like a goose. I snatch green snakes with my
  teeth. I am the flowing branch of almond on the obsidian altar. I am
  the two eyes of god creating. I live in the forehead of god
  dreaming. I am an old man welcomed into heaven. I am the flow and
  nature of things. I am forever&mdash;god's life on earth. The gifts of
  gods are mine: health and power and eternity.
</p>

<p>
  I have seen the face of evil&mdash;one with sharp teeth like a ravaging
  dog that feasts upon corpses, that swallows hearts, that vomits and
  shoots filth from under its tail. I have seen his face, but he has
  not seen himself. His name is eater of millions, envy, jealousy,
  greed, and lust. He is the robber of hours, the passion out of
  control that devours life without tasting it, without being
  nourished by it. Then he is born seven times into a place where
  nothing grows.
</p>

<p>
  I have seen the face of evil&mdash;one with a hundred coils in its tail
  that would claim for itself whatever it touched: the perfume of
  hibiscus, the heart of a lover, the light of its days, the thoughts
  and passions of others. It would clutch these things, squeeze them
  and suck out their vitality. Then the snake would rise up with a
  shake of its tail and name itself god, knower of all, possessed of
  all wisdom. &ldquo;I alone,&rdquo; it cries, &ldquo;know the truth and I shall keep
  it.&rdquo; He is the serpent that separates men from gods.
</p>

<p>
  I have seen the face of evil&mdash;a face full of burns and scars,
  torture inflicted upon the self. He would scald his own chest and
  blame it on others. He would slash his own wrists and blame it on
  the gods. He is the blamer, the finder of fault. He is the author of
  all the ills that befalls him, unrepentant and unconscious. Blind is
  he even to the motion of his own hand that rises up and plucks out
  his eyes.
</p>

<p>
  Who then shall guard us from these terrors? We ourselves and the
  beating heart of Osiris and the bones of his back that make us rise
  up in truth. We shall walk with him around the edge of the Lake of
  Fire. We shall possess the loves, the words, the bodies we know. We
  shall walk glorious in Egypt, our hearts swelling with passion, our
  lungs filled with breath of fire, all the gods and goddesses united
  in one body. Now is the day of the joining of opposites, of the
  mingling of the dust of flesh with the dust of the coffin. This is
  the day of flow, the living ether returned to air, the maker of
  forms assuming new form. This is the day without end&mdash;the passage
  into light itself, the joining of Osiris to Ra.
</p>

<p>
  I have seen the face of justice, the terrible face of Osiris who is
  generator of spirit and degenerator of matter, whose tongue of fire
  licks away flesh, whose mouth devours filth, who stands before
  darkness as a guardian of light. Oh evil ones, fall down and shiver
  for he who lives truth passes by him, but he who lives lies falls,
  is held fast in his nets, is seized in his jaws. He is messenger of
  light, bestower of life and taker away. This white boat of spirit
  ferries the body through dark water, carries the heart of gold
  through the red core of earth. Great is the god in his boat. Great
  are the ways of becoming, the change-and-change again, the cycle of
  truth in the body. Great is the dough of life, malleable god-stuff
  from which earth and heaven are made.
</p>

<p>
  I have seen the face of justice, the beatific face of Osiris, the
  whisperer of truth in the darkness, the power of moving on past
  mortality and illusion. No great evil comes to he who breathes the
  breath of his nostrils, who follows the path of the lightening flash
  that leaps to form between the two worlds.
</p>

<p>
  I am traveler on the way, pure of heart. I am a son fresh from his
  birth. I have eaten the gods' saffron cakes laid out on platters of
  blue faience. I was given the bread of Osiris in the house of
  feasting. I saw the changes in myself, the god in his body, the
  beauty in earth, the gold orb of the sky making the corn green in
  the fields. Those who speak of words of becoming are the goddesses
  of dream and intuition, the magic of earth speaking beneath a
  brilliant sky under a carpet of unfolding yellow flowers. I am he
  who ate the saffron cakes.
</p>

<p>
  I've known the pleasures of earth. I bathed myself in light on an
  afternoon of rejoicing&mdash;not a festival, but an ordinary afternoon
  where I opened my heart to the world and the world came in, where I
  brought water from the well with my daughter, where I chewed the
  grass, ate the figs and sat by the riverbank watching sunlight
  dazzle like the white pearls of my daughter's smile. I steeped
  myself in the passion for existence until my spirit rose like steam
  bearing the fragrance of cedar and flowers. I brought offerings to
  the gods: belladonna and mandrake and wine. I brought moly and
  frankincense, visions of peace unending. I brought turquoise and
  silver and carnelian, the stone of earth's joyful singing. I brought
  the earth ground into the pores of my skin and the melons I grew by
  the river. I brought yesterday and today and the sun rising between
  them, the roar of wind and time like two lions. I brought only those
  things which Ptah had made, which I cared for and gave back. I bring
  home the earth. I bring back the words.
</p>

<p>
  There are days when a man must take up the sword and days when he
  puts it away. For now, at this moment, I am done with
  darkness. Blessed is the world of Ptah. Blessed is the world
  fashioned by his hands. Blessed is the word of Temu's mouth. I am a
  lotus rising up, my thousand petals of existence.
</p>

<p>
  I am watched over by goddesses as Isis concealed her husband in her
  curtain of hair, as she veiled his body in light. The frangrance of
  her perfume falls over me&mdash;her hair! I am under its spell, drunk
  with love, entwined in arms of splendor, born of magic, engendered
  in dream, caught up in the whirl of existence. The weight of the
  heart is severed from me. I am drifting off, spinning, burning,
  waxing, waning... I am taking form. I am embraced in her thighs a
  million years. I am the body of her lover, full of awe and
  passion. And the mortals spin round and round beside me. I am
  refreshed. I come into being.
</p>

<p>
  Now I seize darkness by its arms and shake it. The souls of ancient
  swallowed gods fall out of the belly of obscurity. The old, the few
  and the forgotten walk back into being with me. I am bringing home
  the world. I am triumphant. My wife kisses me twice. I bring to form
  the man I am, the thoughts I imagined, the worlds I dreamed. The
  bones of my head burst into flame. I shoot fiery arrows into night's
  darkness and they are like falling stars, messages of light. I live
  according to what I know and love, the healing of words, the healing
  of herbs, the stealing of kisses, the pleasures and duties of men.
</p>

<p>
  I live in the eye of the lady of flame. I am light reflected in
  Hathor's mirror. The words of goddesses are bright and shining in my
  mouth. I create myself. I am the gods' secret. I have seen the great
  fire of perhaps, the beacon of possibility. I wake in the liquid
  light of a vision. Now Isis stands up and combs her hair.
